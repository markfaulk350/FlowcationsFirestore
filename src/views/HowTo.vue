      tips and tricks for people new to 360
      clean your lense !!!!!
      Do NOT set your 360 lense on the ground or a hard surface
      align the stich-line with the sun to keep exposure the same for each lense
      keep your camera steady and increase frame rate
      When taking 360 photos leave a good 10 - 20 second timer to reduce shaking and motion blur of stand 
      get a good tripod, or light stand, give the camera a good vantage point
      stay out of the photo
      if you color correct your photos, keep the color correction consistent for every photo
      go all out, do it right, I put a ton of time and money into this rocource, simply because I love paragliding, traveling and I want to share that passion with the amazing people in this sport. Thank you for your contributions
